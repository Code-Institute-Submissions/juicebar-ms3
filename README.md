The main purpose of this project is to build a responsive website that allows user to create, read, update and delete (*CRUD*) recipes. **JuiceBar** is a MongoDB based Flask project

The user from the start will have access to all recipes stored in database. If the user wish to manipulate data - they would have to register.

It's a great way to create and store some of your favourite recipes.
